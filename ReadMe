# üîç Fingerprint Matching Using HOG Features and SVM

This project implements a basic fingerprint matching system using image processing and machine learning techniques.
It extracts **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)** features from fingerprint images and trains a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier to identify the best match for a given test fingerprint.

## üéØ Objectives

- To demonstrate fingerprint recognition using classical machine learning.
- To extract robust feature descriptors (HOG) from fingerprint images.
- To train an SVM model to learn unique fingerprint patterns.
- To predict and visualize the best match for a given fingerprint image from a training set.

## üß† How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Loads images from a specified training folder.
   - Assigns a numeric label to each image.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Converts images to grayscale.
   - Resizes them to a uniform size (128x128).
   - Extracts HOG features for shape and pattern analysis.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Uses an SVM classifier with a standard scaler pipeline.
   - Trains the model on extracted HOG features.

4. **Fingerprint Matching**:
   - Extracts features from the test fingerprint image.
   - Predicts similarity scores with all training images.
   - Visualizes the test image and its best match from the training set.
